# ⚖️ Enhancing Judicial Efficiency and Access to Justice Using AI

This project, presented to the **Indiana Supreme Court** and published through the **Decision Sciences Institute**, explores how **AI can responsibly enhance judicial productivity and fairness**. Through a comprehensive blend of **survey analysis**, **NLP techniques**, and **qualitative interviews with judges**, the study identifies how AI can streamline legal workflows while addressing ethical concerns and misinformation risks.

## 📘 Overview

The legal system faces two major AI-related challenges:

1. **AI Integration in Judicial Workflows** – Judges are overwhelmed with administrative tasks; AI can help.
2. **Detection of AI-Generated Evidence** – Courts need reliable tools to identify AI-altered content (e.g., deepfakes, synthetic text).

Our team surveyed over **100 Indiana judges**, conducted **12+ interviews**, and analyzed responses using **Azure Language AI** to extract sentiments and key concerns. We created practical toolkits and best practices for the **Indiana Office of Court Services (IOCS)** to pilot real-world AI solutions.
